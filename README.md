# Arc-kde-icon-theme

This is a project to improve the consistency of the abandoned Arc
Icon Theme on KDE by filling in several gaps using the Breeze and 
Papirus icon sets. The result retains the Arc icons when possible.

One major goal is fixing situations in which the intended Arc icons
are replaced by a fallback theme with a more specific icon.

To use:

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
    sudo make install

Or install from the AUR.

# Contributing

My major short-term goal is to make some modifications to the foreign 
icons so that they fit in more perfectly with the Arc icon theme.

Help with this or new icons are appreciated.
